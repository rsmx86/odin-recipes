Here is the refactored README in English, tailored to match the minimalist and elegant aesthetic of your new project design.

##🍳 Odin Recipes (Refactoring Phase)
This is a practical project developed as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The core objective is to build a streamlined recipe website to master HTML structuring, file path management, and advanced CSS styling.

##🚧 Project Status: Currently undergoing a total refactor to enhance folder organization, minimalist UI/UX, and code quality.

##🛠️ The Project
The website features a minimalist landing page that acts as a curated index, leading to detailed, elegantly styled recipe pages.

Core Structure:

Home Page: index.html featuring a hidden hamburger menu for a distraction-free experience.

Recipe Pages: 3 curated recipes (Classic Lasagna, Chicken & Rice, and Perfect Boiled Eggs) structured with bilingual instructions and clean typography.

Styling: External CSS focused on a "dark mode" aesthetic, using a near-black palette and high-end typography.

##🎨 Design Philosophy
The refactored version moves away from traditional layouts toward a high-fashion, editorial aesthetic:

Minimalism: Removal of unnecessary borders and shadows.

Typography: Contrast between Serif (Playfair Display) and Sans-serif (Inter) fonts.

Color Palette: Deep greys (#121212) and muted whites for a sophisticated look.
